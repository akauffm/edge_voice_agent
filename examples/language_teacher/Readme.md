Minimal language teacher experiment for ES and DE.

* ASR: whisper tiny
* LLM: llama3.2 (1b) -- seems to work better than Gemma3 (still not great and especially in German leading to strange conversations...)
* TTS: piper -- seleced voices that sound most realistic (we still see hallucinations and quite robotic output though...)

Run `setup.sh` first to download necessary models.
